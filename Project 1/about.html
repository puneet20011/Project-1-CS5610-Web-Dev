                  I am a passionate and driven Software Engineer with 4 years of
                  professional experience in the software industry. My journey
                  into technology began in childhood, fueled by a deep curiosity
                  for computers and how they work. Over time, that early
                  fascination evolved into a fulfilling career where I've had
                  the opportunity to work on a range of projects across various
                  domains. While my experience spans multiple areas of software
                  development, I have developed strong skills and growing
                  expertise in full stack web and app development. I enjoy
                  building both front-end and back-end systems and am
                  continuously honing my ability to create seamless, scalable,
                  and user-friendly applications. I'm especially drawn to
                  projects that challenge me to think critically, learn quickly,
                  and deliver high-quality code. Beyond the professional world,
                  I remain deeply engaged with technology and computer science.
                  I'm constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and best
                  practices to stay ahead in a fast-evolving industry. This
                  dedication reflects my belief that great software comes from a
                  mindset of continuous learning and genuine enthusiasm. Outside
                  of work, I enjoy a well-rounded lifestyle that includes
                  playing guitar, lifting weights at the gym, traveling to new
                  places, and watching favorite animeâ€”One Piece, a series that
                  inspires me to never give up. I bring this same passion and
                  energy into everything I do, both professionally and
                  personally.
